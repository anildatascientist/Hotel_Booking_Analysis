# Hotel Booking Analysis

# 📋 Abstract:
Hotels are one of the crucial components of the hospitality industry and also the one which adds to the pride of a city, or country. However, the hotel industry is a highly volatile industry and the bookings depend on a variety of factors such as type of hotels, location, seasonality, days of the week, and many more. The pandemic has further aggravated the highly volatile nature of this important industry. This makes analyzing the patterns available in the past data more important to help the hotels plan it better. Using historical data, hotels can perform various campaigns to boost their business. We can use the patterns to predict future bookings using time series. We have done brainstorming to find out insight from the data by using various technologies such as programming i.e. Python (Pandas, Numpy, etc.), data visualization by python libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, etc.

# Introduction:
The hotel industry is one of the main industries that cater to domestic as well as international tourists. It thus accounts for the GDP of the country as well as provides employment to a wide array of people. 
Thus, it becomes crucial to gain insights from the hotel industry data, in terms of revenue generation, enticing tourists, etc.

Herein our capstone project tries to blend data science with the hotel industry. The descriptive form of data analysis wherein we tried to gain insights from the historical data that we had with us.  Also, based on the trend that we observed, we could predict the future trend that may be followed, i.e., the predictive analysis. And finally, if the hotel wants, they can incorporate the insights we got from the data to plan their future course of action, i.e., prescriptive analysis.
